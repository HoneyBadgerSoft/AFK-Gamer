# AFK-Gamer
I Wrote AFK-Gamer to free up my time while playing Eve Online. 
So what it allows you to do, if you configure it right, is to automate mundane tasks in Eve Online such as DSCANNING and warping to zero. 

# Plugins - Eve Directional Scan Interpreter
When copying directional scan results from Eve Online, the application calculates which ships have appeared on DSCAN and which have disappeared and then announces this verbally using the windows text to speech synthesizer. This means you can sit back and do something you enjoy while AFK-Gamer does the scanning and notification of DSCAN object changes for you.
