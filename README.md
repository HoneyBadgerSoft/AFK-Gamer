# AFK-Gamer
Allows you to automate mundane tasks in EVE-Online such as DSCANNING and warping to zero. 

# Eve Directional Scan Analyzer
When copying directional scan results from Eve Online, AFK-Gamer can calculate which ships have appeared and disappeared on DSCAN. When a something is picked up or changes on DSCAN you will be alerted. 
This means you can sit back and relax while AFK-Gamer does the work for you.

Currently AFK-Gamer is available on a perpetual trial basis which requires downloading and installing the latest version every 14 days. This release model may change in the future.
